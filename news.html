					<p>Big Hit Entertainment, the South Korean company behind blockbuster K-Pop band BTS, is calling for a crackdown on bootleggers.</p>

					<p>In a complaint filed in California district court April 25, Big Hit Entertainment claims an “exclusive right” to the BTS trademark and is calling for court authorization to seize and destroy any unauthorized merchandise being sold outside the group’s concerts by the U.S. Marshal and other law enforcement. The company states bootleged tour and program books, T-shirts, jerseys, sweatshirts, hats, visors, buttons, posters and other such items are “likely to injure the reputation” of Big Hit Entertainment and BTS due to its “inferior” quality.</p>

					<center><br><img src="image/news2.jpg" width="80%"></center>
					<p>BTS made history again this week with the news that their latest album Map of the Soul: Persona, released on April 12, topped the Billboard 200 album chart. Their latest No. 1 album, is the South Korean septet’s third in just under 11 months, a historic feat that aligns them with the likes of Future, the Beatles, and the Monkees, who have all previously achieved three No. 1s in under a year. The album continues to break records, and its lead track “Boy With Luv,” which features Halsey, became their highest song to date on the Hot 100 singles chart, where it landed at No. 8. </p>

					<p>An album full of meaning for both the group and their fandom, known as ARMY, Map of the Soul: Persona draws inspiration from Jungian philosophy and classical mythology, and takes the listeners through the intimate exploration of self and artistry.  </p>
