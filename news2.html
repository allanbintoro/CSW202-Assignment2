					<h2>The Women Behind the Boy Band: 'Map of the Soul: Persona' Songwriters Talk BTS' Chart-Topping Album</h2>
					<small>4/24/2019 by Tamar Herman </small>

					<p>BTS made history again this week with the news that their latest album Map of the Soul: Persona, released on April 12, topped the Billboard 200 album chart. Their latest No. 1 album, is the South Korean septet’s third in just under 11 months, a historic feat that aligns them with the likes of Future, the Beatles, and the Monkees, who have all previously achieved three No. 1s in under a year. The album continues to break records, and its lead track “Boy With Luv,” which features Halsey, became their highest song to date on the Hot 100 singles chart, where it landed at No. 8. </p>

					<p>An album full of meaning for both the group and their fandom, known as ARMY, Map of the Soul: Persona draws inspiration from Jungian philosophy and classical mythology, and takes the listeners through the intimate exploration of self and artistry.  </p>

					<p>Along with BTS and Halsey, over 20 songwriters participated in creating the seven-track album. Though the most high profile person to lend a hand to Map of the Soul: Persona was Ed Sheeran, who co-wrote “Make It Right,” the album is noteworthy for the prominent role female songwriters took in working on it. Since its release, six of them -- all but Halsey and Adora -- spoke with Billboard about their roles in being the women crafting the sound of the biggest boy band around.</p>

					<p>Here’s what they had to say, in order of the songs' placement on the tracklist.</p>

					<p>Melanie Fontana on “Boy With Luv,” talking the morning after appearing with BTS on Saturday Night Live: When they sent me the beat for “Boy With Luv,” I think they said they wanted this song to be the single. At first I was like, “Okay, cool. You know what you want. The beat is cool. But how do you know the single is going to be the single? Do you have an idea of what you want? You already have a vision in your head?” To me, it’s very opposite. Usually the song comes first and then the track can kind of be edited. But with Big Hit [Entertainment], the track comes first and then the topline gets edited, the lyrics and the melody. So they sent me it. I put a verse, I put a pre [hook], I put a rap, I put a chorus. And then they came back and were like, “Can you fix the verse? Can you fix the pre-hook? Can you actually scrap the pre-hook all together? Can you add to the verse? Scrap the pre-hook, and do a brand new chorus.” And I did it, and then they came back and were like, “Send us the stem [files]. We’re going to try writing on it and recording it.” And then we just let it be. And then I found out on Grammy Sunday, when their A&R was in L.A. with them cause they were presenting. I found out that day it was going to be a single. Apparently they already had Halsey on the song, and they didn’t tell me. I just wrote for them. </p>

					<p>Performing on Saturday Night Live was the highest high point I could ever imagine. I spent a lot of time crying happy tears this weekend. Just bursts of emotion. I was literally broke, flat broke, when I moved to L.A. and I had nothing going on, I knew nobody. So I feel very proud of myself and accomplished.</p>

					<p>A thing I noticed about the guys is that they’re really grateful. When I said, “Hey, thanks for having me [perform on SNL],” they were like, “No, no, no. Thank you for saving our song with your beautiful melodies.” I was like, “Wait…” We got to talking, and RM was like, “I was listening to some of your lyrics and I thought they were so cool so I just didn’t change them, I just left them.” It was the “Listen, my, my, baby” and “Oh my my my, oh my my my/ You got me high so fast” parts.</p>

					<p>Emily Weisband on “Boy With Luv”: My part in this is very strange. I’ve always been a big fan of BTS. I was clued into them about six months ago. I’ve seen every video, I’ve listened to all the songs. They just radiated with creativity and talent. So I was already a huge fan of them when, three months after I heard about them, my sister, who manages me, said, “Have you heard about this Korean boy band BTS? Their company wanted to send you a track and have you put some melodies on it.” I was like, “How did they hear about me?” She had no idea. They emailed one of the girls at the publishing company I’m signed to. I have no idea how they heard of me, because I’m not really in the pop world. I’m a Nashville songwriter, so I’m not really in the pop world as much as maybe some other writers on the record are. I’m a country writer. So it was really random. But they sent me the “Boy With Luv” track and I put some melodies on it, back in January.</p>

					<p>The first 50 seconds of the song or so, the first verse into the chorus, is a big chunk of stuff that I sent them. Then I got a text like two weeks ago saying, “Congrats on being on the new BTS single” and I had no clue. I didn’t hear the song until it came out, because they had just used some of my melodies on the song that I had put on the track and sent back to them. I was like, “What, are you kidding me?” And I didn’t know Halsey was on it before it came out and I saw the teaser and I heard the track. When the song came out, my publisher called me and was like, “Go listen! It’s just what you sent them.” And it was, just with some Korean lyrics over it. I had just put random words in there that fit the melody, because I knew that if they did use the melodies they’d put Korean lyrics on it so I didn’t pay as much attention to the words for this. It was crazy.</p>

					<p>Being a Nashville writer, being in the room every day digging into lyrics and that whole thing, it was a super-weird experience for me, in a good way. There are so many ways to make music now with people all over the world who you haven’t met, so it’s just really cool. The fact that we all feel the same things from across the world is just mind blowing to me. I’m just so grateful that they wanted to make it their own and put their words into it.</p>
